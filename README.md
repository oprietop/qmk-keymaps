# qmk-keymaps
my own qmk keymaps

## Notes
After some time syncing to qmk i decided to just leave my keymaps aside as a overlay

## Usage
* Run build.sh <name>:<variant>  
* Example `buid.sh planck/rev6:oprietop`  
* If no argument is used will build some predefined boards  
* Build.sh will clone qmk if not present and will reuse the dir  
* To update/clean qmk just delete the **qmk_firmware** directory beforehand
